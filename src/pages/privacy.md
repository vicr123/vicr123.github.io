# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy was last modified on 19 SEP. 2023, AEST.

## Using Applications

When using Victor Tran applications, any data that is collected never leaves your computer, unless specified otherwise.

Victor Tran applications are designed to protect your privacy, and we won't contact any servers (apart from the purposes of providing updates if you're on non-Linux platforms) or share your data over the internet, unless specified in the application, and only where you opt in.

Victor Tran applications include:
- theDesk
- theSlate
- theBeat
- thePhoto
- theTroposphere

Examples of data sharing inside applications include:
- Using theTroposphere will share your physical location with [MET Norway](https://met.no/en) and Victor Tran for the purposes of collecting weather data for your location and finding the city closest to you.
- Switching on synchronisation of Redshift with the sunrise and sunset will share your physical location with [https://sunrise-sunset.org](https://sunrise-sunset.org) to determine sunrise and sunset times.

## Accessing Services

When accessing Victor Tran services, and where applicable, signing up for an account, we may collect information for the purposes of providing services to you. Victor Tran services include:

- Entertaining Games ([https://entertaining.games/](https://entertaining.games/))
  - This includes all games that connect to the Entertaining Games servers
- Quad ([https://quad.vicr123.com/](https://quad.vicr123.com/))
- AstralMod

Additionally, you may be using a third party that uses Victor Tran services, in which case, this privacy policy applies to data that the third party sends to us. This may be especially true if you got here via a link from a non Victor Tran application.

Your data is stored on servers in the United States of America, owned by [GalaxyGate](https://galaxygate.net/). We use [CloudFlare](https://cloudflare.com/) as a proxy to our servers as protection against malicious attacks. Other than storing your information there, we don't disclose any of it to anyone else.

The CloudFlare privacy policy is available [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/)

### Services where no data is stored on our servers

For some services, data must be sent to Victor Tran services, but the data is not stored. Examples include:

- theTroposphere contacts Victor Tran servers when you add a city, and also when retrieving your location, so we can show city information.
- last.fm integration in theBeat is proxied through CloudFlare servers. No data is saved on Victor Tran servers in this interaction.

In these instances, your data is processed and then discarded immediately.

### Services where data is also stored on third-party servers

Services which also store data on third party servers include:
- Quad
- AstralMod

For Quad and AstralMod, we'll also send information to [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) so your requests can be fulfilled. You can stop your data being sent to Discord by removing the bot from your server.

## Questions or concerns?

If you've got any questions or concerns about our handling of your data, or if you need clarification on exactly what data is being handled based on what you're using, send us an email at [hello@vicr123.com](mailto:hello@vicr123.com) and we'll endeavour to respond to your queries as soon as possible.
