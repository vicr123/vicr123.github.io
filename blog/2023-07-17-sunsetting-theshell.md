After 7 years, it's finally time to say goodbye to theShell.
<!-- truncate -->

**WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THESHELL**<br />
theShell will not receive any more functional or security updates. The source code of theShell will remain available, as always, on [GitHub](https://github.com/vicr123/theshell), but it will be archived.

**THE WAY FORWARD**<br />
If you've been using theShell, now is a great time to move over to theDesk - it's been designed for theShell users to feel right at home, whilst being more stable and easier to maintain.

Thanks,<br />
Victor :)
