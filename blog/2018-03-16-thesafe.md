Hey everyone,

I've created a new backup tool called theSafe.<!-- truncate -->
It uses the `bup` program to actually perform the backups, and will run silently in the background.

Configuring and monitoring theSafe is easy with the configuration tool being made to be simple to use.

You can get the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/vicr123/theSafe).

As always, theSafe is available in the AUR and in my custom repository as a prebuilt binary package for those of you using Arch Linux (or a derivative)

Thanks,<br />
Victor :)
