Hey everyone,

I'm happy to announce that theSlate is now officially available for public preview on Windows, macOS and Linux!
<!-- truncate -->

A few things to note before you go ahead and download theSlate:
- This is a public preview. Development is currently pretty fast so if you want the latest version of theSlate, you should come back and grab it every so often :)
- Most of theSlate is untested. Features may disappear, break or contain critical bugs.

As always, if you happen to find a bug, please [file a bug report](https://github.com/vicr123/theslate/issues) on GitHub.

Thanks,<br />
Victor :)
